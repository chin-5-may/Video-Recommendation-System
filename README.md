# Programming Assignment 3: Video Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two algorithms designed to optimize video recommendations in an online system. The system maximizes revenue by recommending video types to users based on click-through rates and revenue distributions.

## Part 1: Algorithm A - Initial Sampling & Exploitation

### Problem Definition:
Algorithm A is designed to recommend videos to `N` users from `K` video types. The goal is to maximize expected revenue, \(E(p_kR_k)\), where:
- \(p_k\) is the click probability of video type `k`.
- \(R_k\) is the revenue generated by video type `k`.

Since both \(p_k\) and \(R_k\) are unknown, the system must estimate these values and make recommendations that maximize revenue.

### Approach:
1. **Initial Sampling Phase (N1 Users)**:
   - The system initially selects `N1` users and randomly recommends videos from each of the `K` video types.
   - Each video type receives `N1/K` recommendations, and the revenue for each video type is recorded.

2. **Exploitation Phase (Remaining Users)**:
   - For the remaining `N - N1` users, the system recommends videos from the type that generated the highest revenue during the sampling phase.

### Key Challenges:
- **Small N1**: Insufficient data may result in selecting a suboptimal video type.
- **Large N1**: Fewer users are left for exploitation, meaning there is not enough time to benefit from the collected data.

### Tasks:
- Simulate the algorithm for various `N1` values.
- Plot the revenue \(R(N1)\) as a function of `N1` to identify the optimum.
- Compute both the theoretical and empirical probabilities of selecting the wrong video type after `N1` users.

### Results:
- The optimal `N1` is identified by analyzing the balance between exploration and exploitation.
- **Theoretical Probability**: Calculated using the PMF and CDF of the video type with the highest probability.
- **Empirical Probability**: Estimated by simulating video selection based on binomial clicks and repeating the process 1000 times.
